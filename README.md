Hey, thanks for looking over here!
This repository is actually the source code for my Chrome Extension, head over here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/devbot/fkpmacnjdcchjhenacbeiaacjeaehgib

If you would like to modify the code, or prefer the developer version, here's the steps: 
NOTE* This code has been removed of the OPENAI API KEY, and in order to use it, it'll be required to replace the placeholders in each script with your own API key. 

*EXTENSION SETUP*
If you've setup the code right. You can head over to your browser, ideally Chrome.
1. Click the puzzle piece (next to the extensions) on the top right.
2. Head over to manage extensions, and toggle the developer mode switch on the top right.
3. Now, you're able to load the extension on the chrome browser, so click "Load Unpacked" and choose the Devbot folder.

*EXTENSION USE*
Now that you've setup the extension, make sure the extension is enabled.
1. Go to gmail.com or mail.google.com, and compose an email.
2. Type up a short description of what you want the email to be about in the textbox.
3. Select it, by either dragging your mouse, or ctrl+a, and right click.
4. Select "Write an Email AI" and wait a couple seconds, and it'll appear.

If it doesn't work, try rechecking your API key. 

Thanks, 
Mehar
